Automate the Downloading of All Burp Suite Extensions from the PortSwigger BApp Store.

By downloading all the required BApps beforehand, users can then transfer these to an offline environment, such as a secure network where external internet access is restricted due to security policies, or to a personal machine that is not connected to the internet. This ensures that they have all the necessary tools available for their work with Burp Suite without the need for an active internet connection.
